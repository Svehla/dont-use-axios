# Advance use cases

And what if you need to get more functionality from the fetch layer.
I wrote a few extra examples on how to do stuffs like

- httpsOverHttpProxy
- QueryParams
- HTTP timeouts
- caching
- mocking
- logging
- authorizing token renewal
- redirect401

## Extra service layer implementations

### Adding in memory client cache

### Add mocking

### Renew token authorizing

### Logging

## Extra

Fetch is included in 18 as an axperimental API so it looks that we will not need to use node-fetch in the near future

create service layer to have single source of true for your API requests

Btw... what else could we want but `fetch` and not event `axios` provide?

So it looks that axios can do many stuffs for us so why should not we use it?
